# FluxWatch


FluxWatch is a distributed, event-driven intelligence platform that ingests high-volume signals, processes them using a high-performance Rust analytics engine, and delivers real-time insights through an interactive web dashboard.

It is designed as a lightweight, free-tier-friendly alternative to large-scale observability and monitoring platforms, inspired by systems like Datadog, Splunk, and modern SIEM architectures.


Modern applications and systems generate constant streams of events — logs, metrics, transactions, alerts, and telemetry. These raw signals change rapidly (“flux”) and are difficult to interpret in real time.

FluxWatch transforms these dynamic signals into actionable intelligence by:

Detecting statistical anomalies

Identifying trends and abnormal patterns

Applying rule-based evaluations

Assigning severity and risk scores

Streaming live insights to users
